# QAP1
1. hours to complete was 10 or so most just reading and watching videos of all 11 global objects we could pick from, about 1h on jest which i kinda wanna learn more of.
2. online resouces just random web searchs and some YouTube.
3. Didn't ask friends.
4. didn't but i should have because after looking over it there's not much code, should have asked for an example of how deep of a dive we should have done.
5. my biggest issue was just finding what i wanted to do, i prefer to just get told to do something specific.
